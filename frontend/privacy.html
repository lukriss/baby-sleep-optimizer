                <h2>Medical Disclaimer</h2>

                    <p><strong>IMPORTANT: This is not medical advice.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p>The AI Baby Sleep Optimizer provides educational and informational content only. It is not intended
                    to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any medical condition</li>
                    <li>Replace professional medical advice from your pediatrician</li>
                    <li>Substitute for consultation with qualified healthcare providers</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>You should always:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consult your pediatrician before making changes to your baby's sleep routine</li>
                    <li>Seek immediate medical attention if your baby shows signs of illness or distress</li>
                    <li>Discuss any sleep concerns with your healthcare provider</li>
                    <li>Follow your doctor's advice over any information provided by this tool</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Every baby is different. What works for one may not work for another. The sleep plan is a guide based
                    on general research and best practices, not personalized medical advice for your specific situation.

                <h2>Terms of Use</h2>

                <h3>Digital Product</h3>
                <p>The sleep plan is a digital product delivered instantly upon payment. Due to its digital nature,
                    <strong>refunds are not available</strong> once you receive your plan.</p>

                <h3>Personal Use Only</h3>
                <p>Your sleep plan is for personal, non-commercial use. You may not resell, redistribute, or share it
                    publicly.</p>

                <h3>No Guarantees</h3>
                <p>While many parents see improvement in their baby's sleep, we cannot guarantee specific results. Sleep
                    training depends on many factors including consistency, your baby's temperament, and developmental
                    stage.</p>

                <h3>Liability</h3>
                <p>We are not liable for any outcomes resulting from following the sleep plan. You assume all
                    responsibility for implementing the recommendations and for your baby's health and safety.</p>
