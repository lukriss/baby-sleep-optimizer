                    <p><strong>No.</strong> This sleep plan is educational and informational only. It does not replace
                        professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult your pediatrician about
                        your baby's health, development, and sleep concerns.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Every baby is unique. Our AI creates a personalized plan based on your baby's age, current
                        patterns, and your parenting preferences. Most parents see improvement within 3-5 nights, but
                        consistency is key. Some babies take longer—that's completely normal! The plan is a starting
                        point that you can adjust to fit your family's needs.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The sleep plan works for babies aged 0-24 months. The recommendations are age-appropriate and
                        adjust based on your baby's developmental stage. Newborns have different sleep needs than
                        12-month-olds, and our AI accounts for this.</p>

                    <p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> You tell us your parenting style preference in the quiz. If you
                        want gentle/no-cry methods, that's what you'll get. If you're comfortable with some crying or
                        cry-it-out, we'll tailor the plan accordingly. There's no judgment—you know your baby best!</p>

                    <p>Our plans are designed for typically developing babies. If your baby has medical conditions,
                        developmental delays, or special needs, please consult your pediatrician or a pediatric sleep
                        specialist for personalized guidance. This tool may still provide helpful general structure, but

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes! Create a plan for each baby if they have different sleep patterns, or use one plan if
                        they're on similar schedules. Many parents of multiples find it helpful to get both babies on
                        the same routine.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The plan provides evidence-based, age-appropriate guidance, but you should always adjust to your
                        baby's cues. If your baby naturally wakes later or earlier, shift the entire schedule
                        accordingly. The key is consistency in the routine and wake windows, not the exact clock times.
